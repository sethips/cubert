# How to make those 3D data visualizations

You have a CSV file with cluster IDs and x,y,z coordinates. The columns in this file are `[ 'cid', 'x', 'y', 'z' ]`. 

Use `csv2json.py` to convert `data.csv` to `data.json`. Copy `data.json` to `data-projector` directory, open `index.html` in that directory with a browser*.
